## Bio

I study Molecular Biology and Public Health (Biostatistics Concentration) at Johns Hopkins. I am interested in leveraging quantitative tools (STATA, R, Python) to answer questions regarding reproductive & sexual health and oral community health. I am interested in learning more about data visualization and data analytics techniques.
